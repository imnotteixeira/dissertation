abstract = {Reputation mechanisms have become an important component of electronic markets, helping to build trust and elicit cooperation among loosely connected and geographically dispersed economic agents. Understanding the impact of different reputation mechanism design parameters on the resulting market efficiency has thus emerged as a question of theoretical and practical interest. Along these lines, this note studies the impact of the frequency of reputation profile updates on cooperation and efficiency. The principal finding is that, in trading settings with pure moral hazard and noisy ratings, if the per-period profit margin of cooperating sellers is sufficiently high, a mechanism that does not publish every single rating it receives but rather only updates a trader's public reputation profile every k transactions with a summary statistic of a trader's most recent k ratings can induce higher average levels of cooperation and market efficiency than a mechanism that publishes all ratings as soon as they are posted. This paper derives expressions for calculating the optimal profile updating interval k, discusses the implications of this finding for existing systems, such as eBay, and proposes alternative reputation mechanism architectures that attain higher maximum efficiency than the, currently popular, reputation mechanisms that publish summaries of a trader's recent ratings. {\textcopyright} 2006 INFORMS.},

abstract = {Near real-time collaboration using Web browsers is becoming rapidly more and more popular for many applications such as text editing, coding, sketching and others. These applications require reliable algorithms to ensure consistency among the participating Web clients. Operational Transformation (OT) and more recently Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDT) have become widely adopted solutions for this kind of problem. However, most existing approaches are non-trivial and require trade-offs between expressiveness, suitable infrastructure, performance and simplicity. The ever growing number of potential use cases, the new possibilities of cutting-edge messaging protocols that shaped the near real-time Web, and the use of N-way communication between clients (e.g. WebRTC), create a need for peer-topeer algorithms that perform well and are not restricted to only a few supported data types. In this paper, we present YATA, an approach for peer-to-peer shared editing applications that ensures convergence, preserves user intentions, allows offline editing and can be utilized for arbitrary data types in the Web browser. Using Yjs, its open-source JavaScript library implementation, we have evaluated the performance and multiple usage of YATA inWeb and mobile browsers, both on test and real-world data. The promising evaluation results as well as the uptake by many commercial vendors and open-source projects indicate a wide applicability of YATA.},

abstract = {With the fast development of mobile computing and increasing computing capacities of mobile devices, new collaborative applications and platforms are appearing to support collaboration on the move. Indeed, nowadays, members of a team can be not only geographically distributed but they can also work anytime and anywhere thanks to the use of mobile devices. Often, however, team members would like to work either online or offline on a common project; likewise, they may wish to switch among various devices such as laptops, tablets and mobile phones and still work in the same application environment, sharing the same data, etc. In this paper we present a platform that enables application and services migration at runtime between different platforms using the WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) framework. We have studied applications migration both through a central server and through a distributed (Peer-to-Peer) model. Various issues that arise in application migration such as profile matching, application context, data synchronisation and consistency are discussed. The efficiency and scalability of the WebRTC framework and mobile devices (peers) under Android in a real computing infrastructure are studied. Some experimental results on the application migration time according to application state data size are reported.},

The key technology to guarantee the correctness in the graphical editing system is consistency maintenance. It is also a core topic in the field of collaborative computing and a basic research in many scientific and engineering collaboration systems. However, over the past years, the complexity of graphics has produced much problems for the real time editing field, including methods of operational transformation (OT) and conflict resolution strategy with multi-version replication, etc. Recently, CRDT (Exchanged Copy Data Type) has been proposed as a new alternative mechanism in collaborative text editing with much higher efficiency. However, the CRDT-based real-time graphics editing system consistency maintenance method has rarely been studied in the previous literature. In the paper, a kind of CRDT algorithm is proposed, and the complex constraint relationship between the graphics and the dynamic rule library is used to divide the graphic operation into operation, which the relevant solutions are given. The algorithm integrates different types of graphics operations for First, the algorithm guarantees the convergence of the coordinated users and maintains the operational intent under the integrated framework. Secondly, a CRDT-based algorithm is designed. Thirdly, the time complexity and space complexity of the put forward algorithm are theoretically analyzed, which is further verified the feasibility of the algorithm. Finally, The direction of future solution is given.},

There is an increasing interest on its application to real-time communication web services. Based on a case study of CSTA services, we found that communication services exhibit a combination of complex message exchange and stateful behavior patterns, ncluding multi-states, twoway interaction, event-driven, multi-resources, multiresponses and session management, that need to be modeled properly within the framework of REST. To address these challenges, we propose three REST design patterns: session, event subscription and relationship using REST composition. This approach leads to a systematic one-to-one transformation from CSTA to REST. We hope such a study on a concrete use case can contribute to a better understanding of REST and lead to a seamless convergence of communication services with the infrastructure of the Web. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

It allows a group of users simultaneously view and design same graphics documents from geographically dispersed sites connected by computer networks. Conflict resolution and operation consistency remains one of the core issues in this type of systems. This paper discusses the problem about preserving consistency operations in face of conflict, and proposes a multi-version approach to resolve it. In the approach, first operations are divided into two categories, and then a new structure is adopted to represent these operations. It keeps the consistency of operations at very low cost by increasing multiple object versions in face of conflicts. The algorithms presented in this paper have been used in the CoDesign system. The result proves this approach can improve the system performance in the real-time collaborative graphic designing system.},

Past research has focused on controlling negative aspects of conflict by preventing, eliminating or isolating conflicts, but done little on exploring positive aspects of conflict. In this paper, we contribute a novel creative conflict resolution (CCR) approach to address these issues in real-time collaborative editing systems. In addition to maintaining consistency, the CCR approach is able to create new results from conflicts, generate alternative solutions based on collective effects of conflict operations, and support users to choose suitable conflict solutions and conflict resolution policies according to their needs. The CCR approach provides not only a new way of resolving conflicts in real-time collaborative editing systems, but also a framework for supporting a range of existing conflict resolution strategies. Techniques and user interface issues related to the CCR approach and a prototype implementation are discussed in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

abstract = {OT (Operational Transformation) was invented for supporting real-time co-editors in the late 1980s and has evolved to become core techniques widely used in today's working co-editors and adopted in industrial products. CRDT (Commutative Replicated Data Type) for co-editors was first proposed around 2006, under the name of WOOT (WithOut Operational Transformation). Follow-up CRDT variations are commonly labeled as "post-OT" techniques capable of making concurrent operations natively commutative in co-editors. On top of that, CRDT solutions have made broad claims of superiority over OT solutions, and often portrayed OT as an incorrect and inefficient technique. Over one decade later, however, CRDT is rarely found in working co-editors; OT remains the choice for building the vast majority of today's co-editors. Contradictions between the reality and CRDT's purported advantages have been the source of much confusion and debate in co-editing researcher and developer communities. To seek truth from facts, we set out to conduct a comprehensive and critical review on representative OT and CRDT solutions and working co-editors based on them. From this work, we have made important discoveries about OT and CRDT, and revealed facts and evidences that refute CRDT claims over OT on all accounts. These discoveries help explain the underlying reasons for the choice between OT and CRDT in the real world. We report these results in a series of three articles. In this article (the second in the series), we reveal the differences between OT and CRDT in their basic approaches to realizing the same general transformation and how such differences had resulted in different technical challenges and consequential correctness and complexity issues. Moreover, we reveal hidden complexity and algorithmic flaws with representative CRDT solutions, and discuss common myths and facts related to correctness and complexity of OT and CRDT. We hope the discoveries from this work help clear up common myths and confusions surrounding OT and CRDT, and accelerate progress in co-editing technology for real world applications.},

We present Elm, a practical FRP language focused on easy creation of responsive GUIs. Elm has two major features: simple declarative support for Asynchronous FRP; and purely functional graphical layout. Asynchronous FRP allows the programmer to specify when the global ordering of event processing can be violated, and thus enables efficient concurrent execution of FRP programs; long-running computation can be executed asynchronously and not adversely affect the responsiveness of the user interface. Layout in Elm is achieved using a purely functional declarative framework that makes it simple to create and combine text, images, and video into rich multimedia displays. Together, Elm's two major features simplify the complicated task of creating responsive and usable GUIs.},

Web 2.0 is a new medium where users are not just consumers, but are also contributors. By contributing content to the system, users become part of the network and relationships between users and content can be derived. Example applications are collaborative bookmarking networks such as del.icio.us and file sharing applications such as YouTube and Flickr. These networks rely on user contributed content, described and classified using tags. The wealth of user generated content can be hard to navigate and search due to difficulties in comparing documents with similar tags and the application of traditional information retrieval scoring techniques are limited. Evaluating the time evolving interests of users may be used to derive quality of content. In this paper, we propose a technique to rank documents based on reputation.

Through mobile technologies, farmers are aided to quickly and easily communicate, advertise goods and services, as well as accessing agronomic data in soft-real time. Though mobile devices are a good source of agronomic information access and dissemination, the over-dependence on wireless communication protocols for communication is a bit of a challenge. Due to the mobility of farmers, the wireless networks can experience bandwidth fluctuations and that can hamper data transfer and management in mobile-server (cloud) ecosystems. To address this issue, previous works propose mobile data storage to support information access in an offline mode. However, the question of how to efficiently management the data state on the mobile is under-studied. In this work, we proposed a mobile-cloud architecture that enables farmers to manage data transfer and storage of agronomic data on their mobile devices in the face of the network challenges. Three different P2P Key-Value Storage methodologies are presented which are: 1) Bloom Filters algorithm, 2) whole state data transfer, and 3) exchange of delta (updates) only. The whole state data transfer is only recommended when there is stable wireless connection.},

There is little research dealing with disconnection in synchronous groupware from a user and application perspective; as a result, most current groupware systems do not handle disconnection events well, and several user-level problems occur. To address this limitation, we developed the Disco framework, a model for handling several types of disconnection in synchronous groupware. The framework considers how disconnections are identified, what senders and receivers should do during an absence, and what should be done with accumulated data upon reconnection. We have implemented the framework in three applications that show the feasibility, generality, and functionality of our ideas. Our framework is the first to deal with a full range of disconnection issues for synchronous groupware, and shows how groupware can better support the realities of distributed collaboration.

abstract = {Cloud apps like Google Docs and Trello are popular because they enable real-time collaboration with colleagues, and they make it easy for us to access our work from all of our devices. However, by centralizing data storage on servers, cloud apps also take away ownership and agency from users. If a service shuts down, the software stops functioning, and data created with that software is lost. In this article we propose local-first software, a set of principles for software that enables both collaboration and ownership for users. Local-first ideals include the ability to work offline and collaborate across multiple devices, while also improving the security, privacy, long-term preservation, and user control of data. We survey existing approaches to data storage and sharing, ranging from email attachments to web apps to Firebase-backed mobile apps, and we examine the trade-offs of each. We look at Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs): data structures that are multi-user from the ground up while also being fundamentally local and private. CRDTs have the potential to be a foundational technology for realizing local-first software. We share some of our findings from developing local-first software prototypes at the Ink & Switch research lab over the course of several years. These experiments test the viability of CRDTs in practice, and explore the user interface challenges for this new data model. Lastly, we suggest some next steps for moving towards local-first software: for researchers, for app developers, and a startup opportunity for entrepreneurs.},

abstract = {Traditionally web applications have required an internet connection in order to work with data. Browsers have lacked any mechanisms to allow web applications to operate offline with a set of data to provide constant access to applications. Recently, through browser plug-ins such as Google Gears, browsers have gained the ability to persist data for offline use. However, until now it's been difficult for a web developer using these plug-ins to manage persisting data both locally for offline use and in the internet cloud due to: synchronization requirements, managing throughput and latency to the cloud, and making it work within the confines of a standards-compliant web browser. Historically in non-browser environments, programming language environments have offered automated object persistence to shield the developer from these complexities. In our research we have created a framework which introduces automated persistence of data objects for JavaScript utilizing the internet. Unlike traditional object persistence solutions, ours relies only on existing or forthcoming internet standards and does not rely upon specific runtime mechanisms such as OS or interpreter/compiler support. A new design was required in order to be suitable to the internet's unique characteristics of varying connection quality and a browser's specific restrictions. We validate our approach using benchmarks which show that our framework can handle thousands of data objects automatically, reducing the amount of work needed by developers to support offline Web applications. {\textcopyright} 2010 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2).},

abstract = {Collaborative text editing systems allow users to concurrently edit a shared document, inserting and deleting elements (e.g., characters or lines). There are a number of protocols for collaborative text editing, but so far there has been no precise specification of their desired behavior, and several of these protocols have been shown not to satisfy even basic expectations. This paper provides a precise specification of a replicated list object, which models the core functionality of replicated systems for collaborative text editing.We define a strong list specification, which we prove is implemented by an existing protocol, as well as a weak list specification, which admits additional protocol behaviors. A major factor determining the efficiency and practical feasibility of a collaborative text editing protocol is the space overhead of the metadata that the protocol must maintain to ensure correctness. We show that for a large class of list protocols, implementing either the strong or the weak list specification requires a metadata overhead that is at least linear in the number of elements deleted from the list. The class of protocols to which this lower bound applies includes all list protocols that we are aware of, and we show that one of these protocols almost matches the bound.},

Consistency maintenance is one of the most significant challenges in designing and implementing real-time cooperative editing systems. In this article, a consistency model, with properties of convergence, causality preservation, and intention preservation, is proposed as a framework for consistency maintenance in real-time cooperative editing systems. Moreover, an integrated set of schemes and algorithms, which support the proposed consistency model, are devised and discussed in detail. In particular, we have contributed (1) a novel generic operation transformation control algorithm for achieving intention preservation in combination with schemes for achieving convergence and causality preservation and (2) a pair of reversible inclusion and exclusion transformation algorithms for stringwise operations for text editing.

@article{Dellarocas2006-manipulation,
abstract = {There is growing evidence that consumers are influenced by Internet-based opinion forums before making a variety of purchase decisions. Firms whose products are being discussed in such forums are therefore tempted to manipulate consumer perceptions by posting costly anonymous messages that praise their products. This paper offers a theoretical analysis of the impact of such behavior on firm profits and consumer surplus. There are three main results. First, if every firm's manipulation strategy is a monotonically increasing (decreasing) function of that firm's true quality, strategic manipulation of online forums increases (decreases) the information value of a forum to consumers. This result implies the existence of settings where online forum manipulation benefits consumers. Second, equilibria where strategies are monotonically increasing (decreasing) functions of a firm's true quality exist in settings where the firm's net payoff function, inclusive of the cost of manipulation, is supermodular (submodular) in the firm's quality and manipulation action. Third, in a broad class of settings, if the precision of honest consumer opinions that firms manipulate is sufficiently high, firms of all types, as well as society, would be strictly better off if manipulation of online forums was not possible. Nonetheless, firms are locked into a "rat race" and forced to spend resources on such profit-reducing activities; if they don't, consumer perceptions will be biased against them. The social cost of online manipulation can be reduced by developing "filtering" technologies that make it costlier for firms to manipulate. Interestingly, as the amount of user-contributed online content increases, it is firms, and not consumers, that have most to gain from the development of such technologies. {\textcopyright} 2006 INFORMS.},

In this paper, we explore how reverse engineering techniques can help analyze classic web applications for this purpose.

abstract = {High-quality, personalized recommendations are a key feature in many online systems. Since these systems often have explicit knowledge of social network structures, the recommendations may incorporate this information. This paper focuses on networks that represent trust and recommendation systems that incorporate these trust relationships. The goal of a trust-based recommendation system is to generate personalized recommendations by aggregating the opinions of other users in the trust network. In analogy to prior work on voting and ranking systems, we use the axiomatic approach from the theory of social choice. We develop a set of five natural axioms that a trust-based recommendation system might be expected to satisfy. Then, we show that no system can simultaneously satisfy all the axioms. However, for any subset of four of the five axioms we exhibit a recommendation system that satisfies those axioms. Next we consider various ways of weakening the axioms, one of which leads to a unique recommendation system based on random walks. We consider other recommendation systems, including systems based on personalized Page Rank, majority of majorities, and minimum cuts, and search for alternative axiomatizations that uniquely characterize these systems. Finally, we determine which of these systems are incentive compatible, meaning that groups of agents interested in manipulating recommendations can not induce others to share their opinion by lying about their votes or modifying their trust links. This is an important property for systems deployed in a monetized environment.},

abstract = {The original PageRank algorithm for improving the ranking of search-query results computes a single vector, using the link structure of the Web, to capture the relative "importance" of Web pages, independent of any particular search query. To yield more accurate search results, we propose computing a set of PageRank vectors, biased using a set of representative topics, to capture more accurately the notion of importance with respect to a particular topic. For ordinary keyword search queries, we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores for pages satisfying the query using the topic of the query keywords. For searches done in context (e.g., when the search query is performed by highlighting words in a Web page), we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores using the topic of the context in which the query appeared. By using linear combinations of these (precomputed) biased PageRank vectors to generate context-specific importance scores for pages at query time, we show that we can generate more accurate rankings than with a single, generic PageRank vector. We describe techniques for efficiently implementing a large-scale search system based on the topic-sensitive PageRank scheme.},

abstract = {In this paper, we extensively tune and then compare the performance of web servers based on three different server architectures. The $\mu$server utilizes an event-driven architecture, Knot uses the highly-efficient Capriccio thread library to implement a thread-per-connection model, and WatPipe uses a hybrid of events and threads to implement a pipeline-based server that is similar in spirit to a staged event-driven architecture (SEDA) server like Haboob. We describe modifications made to the Capriccio thread library to use Linux's zero-copy sendfile interface. We then introduce the SY mmetric Multi-Processor Event Driven (SYMPED) architecture in which relatively minor modifications are made to a single process event-driven (SPED) server (the $\mu$server) to allow it to continue processing requests in the presence of blocking due to disk accesses. Finally, we describe our C++ implementation of WatPipe, which although utilizing a pipeline-based architecture, excludes the dynamic controls over event queues and thread pools used in SEDA. When comparing the performance of these three server architectures on the workload used in our study, we arrive at different conclusions than previous studies. In spite of recent improvements to threading libraries and our further improvements to Capriccio and Knot, both the event-based $\mu$server and pipeline-based Wat-Pipe server provide better throughput (by about 18%). We also observe that when using blocking sockets to send data to clients, the performance obtained with some architectures is quite good and in one case is noticeably better than when using non-blocking sockets.

Our toolkit provides various strategies for synchronizing relational database tables between the browser and the web server, along with a client-side template library so that portions web applications may be executed client-side. Unlike prior work in this area, Sync Kit persists both templates and data in the browser across web sessions, increasing the number of concurrent connections a server can handle by up to a factor of four versus that of a traditional server-only web stack and a factor of three versus a recent template caching approach. {\textcopyright} 2010 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2).},

This ensures performance and scalability in large-scale distributed systems (e.g., clouds). However, published EC approaches are ad-hoc and error-prone. Under a formal Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC) model, we study sufficient conditions for convergence. A data type that satisfies these conditions is called a Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT). Replicas of any CRDT are guaranteed to converge in a self-stabilising manner, despite any number of failures. This paper formalises two popular approaches (state- and operation-based) and their relevant sufficient conditions. We study a number of useful CRDTs, such as sets with clean semantics, supporting both add and remove operations, and consider in depth the more complex Graph data type. CRDT types can be composed to develop large-scale distributed applications, and have interesting theoretical properties. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

However, extracting a pure reputation signal from ratings is difficult because of data sparseness and several confounding factors in users'voting behavior.

These systems frequently require fine-granularity sharing of data and fast response times. This paper distinguishes real-time groupware systems from other multi-user systems and discusses their concurrency control requirements. An algorithm for concurrency control in real-time groupware systems is then presented. The advantages of this algorithm are its simplicity of use and its responsiveness: users can operate directly on the data without obtaining locks. The algorithm must know some semantics of the operations. However the algorithm's overall structure is independent of the semantic information, allowing the algorithm to be adapted to many situations.

The book serves two very different audiences: the curious science reader and the technical computational reader. The chapters build in mathematical sophistication, so that the first five are accessible to the general academic reader. While other chapters are much more mathematical in nature, each one contains something for both audiences. For example, the authors include entertaining asides such as how search engines make money and how the Great Firewall of China influences research. The book includes an extensive background chapter designed to help readers learn more about the mathematics of search engines, and it contains several MATLAB codes and links to sample web data sets. The philosophy throughout is to encourage readers to experiment with the ideas and algorithms in the text. Any business seriously interested in improving its rankings in the major search engines can benefit from the clear examples, sample code, and list of resources provided. ‚Ä¢ Many illustrative examples and entertaining asides ‚Ä¢ MATLAB code ‚Ä¢ Accessible and informal style ‚Ä¢ Complete and self-contained section for mathematics review.},

While traditionally collaborative editing systems would either target synchronous or asynchronous collaboration settings, some recent systems support both types of collaboration, even supporting disconnected work. In this paper we analyze the limitations of existing systems and propose a data management solution that overcomes such limitations. The proposed concurrency control algorithm, based on conflict-free data types, builds on the ideas previously developed for synchronous collaboration, extending them to support asynchronous collaboration. Our solution also includes the necessary information for providing comprehensive awareness information to users. The evaluation of our algorithm shows that comparing our solution with traditional solutions in collaborative editing, the conflict resolution strategy proposed in this paper leads to results closer to the ones expected by users. {\textcopyright} 2013 ICST.},

abstract = {Trust between agents in multi-agent systems (MASs) is critical to encourage high levels of cooperation. Existing methods to assess trust and reputation use direct and indirect past experiences about an agent to estimate their future performance; however, these will not always be representative if agents change their behaviour over time.Real-world distributed networks such as online market places, P2P networks, pervasive computing and the Smart Grid can be viewed as MAS. Dynamic agent behaviour in such MAS can arise from seasonal changes, cheaters, supply chain faults, network traffic and many other reasons. However, existing trust and reputation models use limited techniques, such as forgetting factors and sliding windows, to account for dynamic behaviour.In this paper, we propose Reacting and Predicting in Trust and Reputation (RaPTaR), a method to extend existing trust and reputation models to give agents the ability to monitor the output of interactions with a group of agents over time to identify any likely changes in behaviour and adapt accordingly. Additionally, RaPTaR can provide an a priori estimate of trust when there is little or no interaction data (either because an agent is new or because a detected behaviour change suggests recent past experiences are no longer representative). Our results show that RaPTaR has improved performance compared to existing trust and reputation methods when dynamic behaviour causes the ranking of the best agents to interact with to change.},

@article{Chengzheng2020,
abstract = {OT (Operational Transformation) was invented for supporting real-time co-editors in the late 1980s and has evolved to become a collection of core techniques widely used in today's working co-editors and adopted in major industrial products. CRDT (Commutative Replicated Data Type) for co-editors was first proposed around 2006, under the name of WOOT (WithOut Operational Transformation). Follow-up CRDT variations are commonly labeled as ‚Äúpost-OT‚Äù techniques capable of making concurrent operations natively commutativity in co-editors. On top of that, CRDT solutions have made broad claims of superiority over OT solutions, and routinely portrayed OT as an incorrect, complex and inefficient technique. Over one decade later, however, CRDT is rarely found in working co-editors, and OT remains the choice for building the vast majority of today's co-editors. Contradictions between the reality and CRDT's purported advantages have been the source of much confusion and debate in co-editing research and developer communities. Have the vast majority of co-editors been unfortunate in choosing the faulty and inferior OT, or those CRDT claims are false? What are the real differences between OT and CRDT for co-editors? What are the key factors and underlying reasons behind the choices between OT and CRDT in the real world? A thorough examination of these questions is relevant not only to researchers who are exploring the frontiers of co-editing technologies and systems, but also to practitioners who are seeking viable techniques to build real world applications. To seek truth from facts, we set out to conduct a comprehensive and critical review on representative OT and CRDT solutions and working co-editors based on them. From this work, we have made important discoveries about OT and CRDT, and revealed facts and evidences that refute CRDT claims over OT on all accounts. We report our discoveries in a series of articles and the current article is the first one in this series. In this paper, we present a general transformation framework for consistency maintenance in co-editors, which was distilled from dissecting and examining representative OT and CRDT solutions (and other alternative solutions) during this work, and report our discoveries under the guidance of this framework. In particular, we reveal that CRDT is like OT in following a general transformation approach, but achieves the same transformation indirectly, in contrast to OT direct transformation approach; and CRDT is not natively commutative for concurrent co-editing operations, but has to achieve the same OT commutativity indirectly as well, with consequential correctness and complexity issues. Uncovering the hidden transformation nature and demystifying the commutativity property of CRDT provides much-needed clarity about what CRDT really is and is not to co-editing, and serves as the foundation to explore the real differences between OT and CRDT in correctness, complexity, implementation, and real world applications, which are reported in follow-up articles. We hope discoveries from this work help clear up common misconceptions and confusions surrounding OT and CRDT, and accelerate progress in co-editing technology for real world applications.},

Such systems have been traditionally used in diverse areas, such as e-commerce or tourism. Within this context, group recommender systems address the problem of generating recommendations for groups of users who might have different interests. Although different aggregation processes have been extensively utilized in real-life applications to generate group recommendations, such processes do not guarantee that the list of products recommended to the group reflect a high agreement level among its members' individual preferences. Given the need for considering the added value of obtaining group recommendations under a high agreement level, this paper presents a novel group recommender system methodology that attempts to reach a high level of consensus among individual recommendations of group members. To do this, and inspired by existing group decision-making approaches in the literature, a consensus reaching process is carried out to bring such individual recommendations closer to each other before delivering the group recommendations.},

So far, this technology is well known for building trust and harnessing cooperation in on-line marketplaces, such as Amazon (www.amazon.com) and eBay (www.ebay.es). However, these mechanisms are poised to have a broader impact on a wide range of scenarios, from large scale decision making procedures, such as the ones implied in e-democracy, to trust based recommendations on e-health context or influence and performance assessment in e-marketing and e-learning systems. This contribution surveys the progress in understanding the new possibilities and challenges that trust and reputation systems pose. To do so, it discusses trust, reputation and influence which are important measures in networked based communication mechanisms to support the worthiness of information, products, services opinions and recommendations. The existent mechanisms to estimate and propagate trust and reputation, in distributed networked scenarios, and how these measures can be integrated in decision making to reach consensus among the agents are analysed. Furthermore, it also provides an overview of the relevant work in opinion dynamics and influence assessment, as part of social networks. Finally, it identifies challenges and research opportunities on how the so called trust based network can be leveraged as an influence measure to foster decision making processes and recommendation mechanisms in complex social networks scenarios with uncertain knowledge, like the mentioned in e-health and e-marketing frameworks.},

Users now produce most of the information on the World Wide Web. Most of the interaction and information management with web applications is carried out on the client side, in the local browser. However, there is not always connectivity with the web platform. Several factors prevent users from connecting with remote servers: rural areas, natural disasters or situations without coverage. These situations, among others, motivated the creation and use of offline or disconnected web applications. The present work takes an indepth look at the problems of using existent web applications in offline scenarios. To that end, the offline proxy is introduced.

abstract = {Peer-to-Peer (P2P) reputation systems are essential to evaluate the trustworthiness of participating peers and to combat the selfish, dishonest, and malicious peer behaviors. The system collects locally-generated peer feedbacks and aggregates them to yield the global reputation scores. Surprisingly, most previous work ignored the distribution of peer feedbacks. We use a trust overlay network (TON) to model the trust relationships among peers. After examining the eBay transaction trace of over 10,000 users, we discover a power-law distribution in user feedbacks. Our mathematical analysis justifies that power-law distribution is applicable to any dynamically growing P2P systems, either structured or unstructured. We develop a robust and scalable P2P reputation system, PowerTrust, to leverage the power-law feedback characteristics. The PowerTrust system dynamically selects small number of power nodes that are most reputable using a distributed ranking mechanism. By using a look-ahead random walk strategy and leveraging the power nodes, PowerTrust significantly improves in global reputation accuracy and aggregation speed. PowerTrust is adaptable to dynamics in peer joining and leaving and robust to disturbance by malicious peers. Through P2P network simulation experiments, we find significant performance gains in using PowerTrust. This power-law guided reputation system design proves to achieve high query success rate in P2P file-sharing applications. The system also reduces the total job makespan and failure rate in large-scale, parameter-sweeping P2P Grid applications. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

When creating mobile applications, developers usually encounter the cross-platform incompatibility problem (for example, iPhone applications cannot be executed on the Android platform). Moreover, because mobile Web browsers have increasingly supported more and more Web-related standards, Web applications are more possible to be executed on different platforms than mobile applications. However, the problem of Web application is that it cannot be executed in offline mode. This study proposes a Web-based platform for executing applications on mobile devices. This platform provides several services for developers such as offline service, content adaptation service, and synchronization service. With the help of the proposed platform, application developers can develop and publish offline Web applications easily with simplified external Web content and synchronization capability. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Mobile technology is particularly suited to a fully distributed (replicated) architecture for collaborative work. Users can maintain their own document copies, and can continue to work in the absence of a central server. However, in a replicated architecture, conflicts can occur when two or more users concurrently modify the same object in a shared document. Such conflicts can be classified as non-exclusive or exclusive. Non-exclusive conflicts, where conflicting operations can be realized at the same time, can be handled using conventional consistency management techniques such Abstract: operational transformation. On the other hand, exclusive conflicts can only be realised in different document versions. Although post-locking (Xue, Zhang, and Sun 2001) can be used to limit the number of versions that are created and thus reduce storage requirements in constrained mobile devices, it introduces two problems: a partial-intention problem and the need to synchronise locks before the conflict can be resolved. This paper introduces an algorithm that integrates operational transformation and multi-versioning to resolve the different types of conflict. The algorithm uses delayed post-locking to solve the partial-intention problem by making use of user intention locks. It also uses conflict tables to better facilitate the resolution of conflict as soon as possible without requiring sites to receive all operations..

abstract = {HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) cookies are widely used on the web to enhance communication efficiency between a client and a server by storing stateful information. However, cookies may contain private and sensitive information about users. Thus, in order to guarantee the security of cookies, most web browsers and servers support not only Transport Layer Security (TLS) but also other mechanisms such as HTTP Strict Transport Security and cookie flags. However, a recent study has shown that it is possible to circumvent cookie flags in HTTPS by exploiting a vulnerability in HTTP software that allows message truncation. In this paper, we propose a novel cookie hijacking attack called rotten$\sim$cookie which deactivates cookie flags even if they are protected by TLS by exploiting a weakness in HTTP in terms of integrity checks. According to our investigation, all major browsers ignore uninterpretable sections of the header of HTTP response messages and accept incorrect formats without any rejection. We demonstrate that, when combined with TLS or application vulnerabilities, this form of attack can obtain private cookies by removing cookie flags. Thus, the attacker can impersonate a legitimate user in the eyes of the server when cookies are used as an authentication token. We prove the practicality of our attack by demonstrating that our attack can lead five major web browsers to accept a cookie without any cookie flags. We thus present a mitigation strategy for the transport layer to preserve cookie security against our attack.},

abstract = {The optimistic consistency control method known as Operational Transformation (OT) has been studied by researchers for nearly three decades, with centralized versions lying at the heart of most real-time web co-editing tools in academia and industry. Concurrent document editing is now a 'must-have' for the modern workplace, with proven benefits in team productivity and efficiency. Once limited to primitive insert and delete operations, OT algorithms have evolved to support hierarchical data structures such as XML in order to meet the increasingly complex requirements of present-day collaborative applications. However, previous approaches have not focused on the changes that web applications enact upon the Document Object Model (DOM) of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) standard. This paper will present a feedback-based real-time architecture that allows arbitrary DOM-based document replicas to remain consistent by defining a new set of operations that preserve the user's editing intentions. The control loop of the architecture enables simultaneous DOM-based modifications by using novel conflict resolution algorithms and methods that bring 'Virtual DOM' concepts together with state-of-the-art OT principles to enable advanced operations such as moving, splitting and merging of hierarchical DOM nodes. Through the implementation and evaluation of a rich-text editor, it will be shown how the architecture facilitates and accelerates the development of multi-user interactive web applications that meet today's demanding latency, scalability and accessibility requirements.},

abstract = {Causality tracking mechanisms, such as vector clocks and version vectors, rely on mappings from globally unique identifiers to integer counters. In a system with a well known set of entities these ids can be preconfigured and given distinct positions in a vector or distinct names in a mapping. Id management is more problematic in dynamic systems, with large and highly variable number of entities, being worsened when network partitions occur. Present solutions for causality tracking are not appropriate to these increasingly common scenarios. In this paper we introduce Interval Tree Clocks, a novel causality tracking mechanism that can be used in scenarios with a dynamic number of entities, allowing a completely decentralized creation of processes/replicas without need for global identifiers or global coordination. The mechanism has a variable size representation that adapts automatically to the number of existing entities, growing or shrinking appropriately. The representation is so compact that the mechanism can even be considered for scenarios with a fixed number of entities, which makes it a general substitute for vector clocks and version vectors. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

As information technology dramatically reduces the cost of accumulating, processing and disseminating consumer feedback, it is plausible to ask whether such mechanisms can provide an economically more efficient solution to a wide range of moral hazard settings where societies currently rely on the threat of litigation in order to induce cooperation. In this paper we compare online reputation to legal enforcement as institutional mechanisms in terms of their ability to induce cooperative behavior. Furthermore, we explore the impact of information technology on their relative economic efficiency.

Besides developing apps from scratch, Web application developers often meet these challenges by employing ready-made libraries for shared editing on the Web. A new generation of these shared editing frameworks has emerged recently; several of these libraries are available as open source solutions. In this paper, we first present general and browser-specific requirements for shared editing like consistency algorithms and means of workspace awareness. Then, state-of-the-art frameworks for shared editing are analyzed in respect of their support of these requirements. As a contribution, we have identified missing features like the availability of general awareness widgets and new architectural designs due to emerging Web standards.

abstract = {It is important to enable peers to represent and update their trust in other peers in open networks for sharing files, and especially services. We propose a Bayesian network-based trust model and a method for building reputation based on recommendations in peer-to-peer networks. Since trust is multifaceted, peers need to develop differentiated trust in different aspects of other peers' capability. The peer's needs are different in different situations. Depending on the situation, a peer may need to consider its trust in a specific aspect of another peer's capability or in multiple aspects. Bayesian networks provide a flexible method to present differentiated trust and combine different aspects of trust. The evaluation of the model using a simulation shows that the system where peers communicate their experiences (recommendations) outperforms the system where peers do not share recommendations with each other and that a differentiated trust adds to the performance in terms of percentage of successful interactions.},

abstract = {Massive collaborative editing becomes a reality through leading projects such as Wikipedia. This massive collaboration is currently supported with a costly central service. In order to avoid such costs, we aim to provide a peer-to-peer collaborative editing system. Existing approaches to build distributed collaborative editing systems either do not scale in terms of number of users or in terms of number of edits. We present the Logoot approach that scales in these both dimensions while ensuring causality, consistency and intention preservation criteria. We evaluate the Logoot approach and compare it to others using a corpus of all the edits applied on a set of the most edited and the biggest pages of Wikipedia. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {User reputation systems are widely used in Ecommerce website and social networks. In present most of the user reputation systems use the rule-based method or the voting systems to calculate user reputations. These systems heavily depend on the experience of experts. In this paper we try to use machine learning method to automatically learn user reputation in social networks. The social network we selected is a financial forum. A social network is seen as a directed graph, every user in the networks is a node in the graph, and the interactions between the users are the directed edges. Then we extract features of users from the social network graph. We translate the reputation learning problem into the document ranking problem, and use the listwise based rank learning method to build the reputation model. The reputation prediction model is represented as a linear model. We use the model to predict user reputation. The experimental results show that using rank learning method to predict user reputation is effective.},

@inproceedings{Nicolaescu2013,
abstract = {Collaboration on digital products - for instance in science, design or production - is typically being practiced using cumbersome means like sending document drafts back and forth among collaborators. Recent advances in Web technologies allow collaborators to synchronously edit artifacts. From an engineering perspective, adding (near) real-time, multi-user collaboration to single-user applications is a challenging task as it requires the implementation of features such as conflict resolution as well as propagation and visualization of updates in near real-time. In this paper, we present SyncLD, a collaborative system that was built for a community of practice on 'learning design' to support Web-based, synchronous collaborative editing of learning design models. The system was built on widget technology and implements propagation of edits using inter-widget communication based on the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as well as synchronization of edits using Operational Transformation algorithms. A system evaluation shows that the near real-time collaboration features work as intended, and an end-user evaluation demonstrates the usefulness and usability perceived by practitioners. The core near real-time features are bundled in an open-source library that can be reused for building applications for similar use cases, hopefully propelling the future availability and adoption of near real-time collaboration as a standard feature in Web applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 ICST.},

@article{Abertos-Marco2017,
abstract = {The ubiquitousness of the Internet is changing the way users perform their tasks. There is a trend and sometimes a real need to be always connected. The client-server paradigm used in the Web greatly facilitates the consumption of contents. However, there are many situations where the user's tasks in a Web application might be interrupted due to an unexpected loss of connectivity, temporary unavailability of Web servers, external events, etc., setting the browse to an offline state. The availability of local storage in Web browsers might suggest that users can perform some of their tasks when offline. Nonetheless, several technical constraints might prevent users from efficiently resuming their tasks over the Web after the offline period. In this paper we present a model-based approach called the Offline Model, which is aimed at supporting the execution of tasks interrupted by loss of connectivity based on user navigation with Web applications. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the Offline Model can be exploited to mitigate some of the disruptive effects of interruptions, due to offline navigation, on user tasks based on Web navigation in existent Web applications. The feasibility of such a model approach is demonstrated by a support tool and illustrated by a case study of navigation in a real scenario: the DBLP Web site.},

abstract = {The emergence of web-based Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) has raised several concerns about the quality of Knowledge Objects (KO), which are the building blocks of knowledge expertise. Web-based KMSs offer large knowledge repositories with millions of resources added by experts or uploaded by users, and their content must be assessed for accuracy and relevance. To improve the efficiency of ranking KOs, two models are proposed for KO evaluation. Both models are based on user interactions and exploit user reputation as an important factor in quality estimation. For the purpose of evaluating the performance of the two proposed models, the algorithms were implemented and incorporated in a KMS. The results of the experiment indicate that the two models are comparable in accuracy, and that the algorithms can be integrated in the search engine of a KMS to estimate the quality of KOs and accordingly rank the results of user searches.},

abstract = {Client-side apps (e.g., mobile or in-browser) need cloud data to be available in a local cache, for both reads and updates. For optimal user experience and developer support, the cache should be consistent and fault-tolerant. In order to scale to high numbers of unreliable and resource-poor clients, and large database, the system needs to use resources sparingly. The SwiftCloud distributed object database is the first to provide fast reads and writes via a causally-consistent client-side local cache backed by the cloud. It is thrifty in resources and scales well, thanks to consistent versioning provided by the cloud, using small and bounded metadata. It remains available during faults, switching to a different data centre when the current one is not responsive, while maintaining its consistency guarantees. This paper presents the SwiftCloud algorithms, design, and experimental evaluation. It shows that client-side apps enjoy the high performance and availability, under the same guarantees as a remote cloud data store, at a small cost.},

abstract = {Reputation systems concern soft security dynamics in diverse areas. Trust dynamics in a reputation system should be stable and adaptable at the same time to serve the purpose. Many reputation mechanisms have been proposed and tested over time. However, the main drawback of reputation management is that users need to share private information to gain trust in a system such as phone numbers, reviews, and ratings. Recently, a novel model that tries to overcome this issue was presented: the Dynamic Interaction-based Reputation Model (DIBRM). This approach to trust considers only implicit information automatically deduced from the interactions of users within an online community. In this primary research study, the Reddit and MathOverflow online social communities have been selected for testing DIBRM. Results show how this novel approach to trust can mimic behaviors of the selected reputation systems, namely Reddit and MathOverflow, only with temporal information.},
