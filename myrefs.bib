abstract = {Trust between agents in multi-agent systems (MASs) is critical to encourage high levels of cooperation. Existing methods to assess trust and reputation use direct and indirect past experiences about an agent to estimate their future performance; however, these will not always be representative if agents change their behaviour over time.Real-world distributed networks such as online market places, P2P networks, pervasive computing and the Smart Grid can be viewed as MAS. Dynamic agent behaviour in such MAS can arise from seasonal changes, cheaters, supply chain faults, network traffic and many other reasons. However, existing trust and reputation models use limited techniques, such as forgetting factors and sliding windows, to account for dynamic behaviour.In this paper, we propose Reacting and Predicting in Trust and Reputation (RaPTaR), a method to extend existing trust and reputation models to give agents the ability to monitor the output of interactions with a group of agents over time to identify any likely changes in behaviour and adapt accordingly. Additionally, RaPTaR can provide an a priori estimate of trust when there is little or no interaction data (either because an agent is new or because a detected behaviour change suggests recent past experiences are no longer representative). Our results show that RaPTaR has improved performance compared to existing trust and reputation methods when dynamic behaviour causes the ranking of the best agents to interact with to change.},

With the big amount of collected data from community-based applications, it becomes necessary to know wheather such content is trustworhty. When using applications such as Waze, we are supposed to trust in the information provided by unknown users, which act as digital content producers. However, it needs to be transparently clear where this information comes from and how trustable are its providers/endorsers. This paper presents the results of a two-step study to investigate how users recognize (or not) the signs and the reputation model of digital content producers in Waze app. We analysed and found out how the reputation is communicated to the users and the potential impacts on human computer interaction.},

In present most of the user reputation systems use the rule-based method or the voting systems to calculate user reputations. These systems heavily depend on the experience of experts. In this paper we try to use machine learning method to automatically learn user reputation in social networks. The social network we selected is a financial forum. A social network is seen as a directed graph, every user in the networks is a node in the graph, and the interactions between the users are the directed edges. Then we extract features of users from the social network graph. We translate the reputation learning problem into the document ranking problem, and use the listwise based rank learning method to build the reputation model. The reputation prediction model is represented as a linear model. We use the model to predict user reputation. The experimental results show that using rank learning method to predict user reputation is effective.},

Intuitively, a reputable user posts high quality comments and is highly rated by the user community. To our surprise, we find that the quality of a comment judged editorially is almost uncorrelated with the ratings that it receives, but can be predicted using standard text features, achieving accuracy as high as the agreement between two editors! However, extracting a pure reputation signal from ratings is difficult because of data sparseness and several confounding factors in users'voting behavior.

Web-based KMSs offer large knowledge repositories with millions of resources added by experts or uploaded by users, and their content must be assessed for accuracy and relevance. To improve the efficiency of ranking KOs, two models are proposed for KO evaluation. Both models are based on user interactions and exploit user reputation as an important factor in quality estimation. For the purpose of evaluating the performance of the two proposed models, the algorithms were implemented and incorporated in a KMS. The results of the experiment indicate that the two models are comparable in accuracy, and that the algorithms can be integrated in the search engine of a KMS to estimate the quality of KOs and accordingly rank the results of user searches.},

Web 2.0 is a new medium where users are not just consumers, but are also contributors. By contributing content to the system, users become part of the network and relationships between users and content can be derived. Example applications are collaborative bookmarking networks such as del.icio.us and file sharing applications such as YouTube and Flickr. These networks rely on user contributed content, described and classified using tags. The wealth of user generated content can be hard to navigate and search due to difficulties in comparing documents with similar tags and the application of traditional information retrieval scoring techniques are limited. Evaluating the time evolving interests of users may be used to derive quality of content. In this paper, we propose a technique to rank documents based on reputation. The reputation is a combination of the number of bookmarkers, the reputation of the bookmarking user and the time dynamics of the document Experimental results and analysis are presented on a large collaborative IBM bookmarking network called Dogear. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {High-quality, personalized recommendations are a key feature in many online systems. Since these systems often have explicit knowledge of social network structures, the recommendations may incorporate this information. This paper focuses on networks that represent trust and recommendation systems that incorporate these trust relationships. The goal of a trust-based recommendation system is to generate personalized recommendations by aggregating the opinions of other users in the trust network. In analogy to prior work on voting and ranking systems, we use the axiomatic approach from the theory of social choice. We develop a set of five natural axioms that a trust-based recommendation system might be expected to satisfy. Then, we show that no system can simultaneously satisfy all the axioms. However, for any subset of four of the five axioms we exhibit a recommendation system that satisfies those axioms. Next we consider various ways of weakening the axioms, one of which leads to a unique recommendation system based on random walks. We consider other recommendation systems, including systems based on personalized Page Rank, majority of majorities, and minimum cuts, and search for alternative axiomatizations that uniquely characterize these systems. Finally, we determine which of these systems are incentive compatible, meaning that groups of agents interested in manipulating recommendations can not induce others to share their opinion by lying about their votes or modifying their trust links. This is an important property for systems deployed in a monetized environment.},

To yield more accurate search results, we propose computing a set of PageRank vectors, biased using a set of representative topics, to capture more accurately the notion of importance with respect to a particular topic. For ordinary keyword search queries, we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores for pages satisfying the query using the topic of the query keywords. For searches done in context (e.g., when the search query is performed by highlighting words in a Web page), we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores using the topic of the context in which the query appeared. By using linear combinations of these (precomputed) biased PageRank vectors to generate context-specific importance scores for pages at query time, we show that we can generate more accurate rankings than with a single, generic PageRank vector. We describe techniques for efficiently implementing a large-scale search system based on the topic-sensitive PageRank scheme.},

As information technology dramatically reduces the cost of accumulating, processing and disseminating consumer feedback, it is plausible to ask whether such mechanisms can provide an economically more efficient solution to a wide range of moral hazard settings where societies currently rely on the threat of litigation in order to induce cooperation. In this paper we compare online reputation to legal enforcement as institutional mechanisms in terms of their ability to induce cooperative behavior. Furthermore, we explore the impact of information technology on their relative economic efficiency. We find that although both mechanisms result in losses relative to the maximum possible social surplus, under certain conditions online reputation outperforms litigation in terms of maximizing the total surplus, and thus the resulting social welfare.},

Such systems have been traditionally used in diverse areas, such as e-commerce or tourism. Within this context, group recommender systems address the problem of generating recommendations for groups of users who might have different interests. Although different aggregation processes have been extensively utilized in real-life applications to generate group recommendations, such processes do not guarantee that the list of products recommended to the group reflect a high agreement level among its members' individual preferences. Given the need for considering the added value of obtaining group recommendations under a high agreement level, this paper presents a novel group recommender system methodology that attempts to reach a high level of consensus among individual recommendations of group members. To do this, and inspired by existing group decision-making approaches in the literature, a consensus reaching process is carried out to bring such individual recommendations closer to each other before delivering the group recommendations.},

Understanding the impact of different reputation mechanism design parameters on the resulting market efficiency has thus emerged as a question of theoretical and practical interest. Along these lines, this note studies the impact of the frequency of reputation profile updates on cooperation and efficiency. The principal finding is that, in trading settings with pure moral hazard and noisy ratings, if the per-period profit margin of cooperating sellers is sufficiently high, a mechanism that does not publish every single rating it receives but rather only updates a trader's public reputation profile every k transactions with a summary statistic of a trader's most recent k ratings can induce higher average levels of cooperation and market efficiency than a mechanism that publishes all ratings as soon as they are posted. This paper derives expressions for calculating the optimal profile updating interval k, discusses the implications of this finding for existing systems, such as eBay, and proposes alternative reputation mechanism architectures that attain higher maximum efficiency than the, currently popular, reputation mechanisms that publish summaries of a trader's recent ratings. {\textcopyright} 2006 INFORMS.},

@article{Dellarocas2006-manipulation,
abstract = {There is growing evidence that consumers are influenced by Internet-based opinion forums before making a variety of purchase decisions. Firms whose products are being discussed in such forums are therefore tempted to manipulate consumer perceptions by posting costly anonymous messages that praise their products. This paper offers a theoretical analysis of the impact of such behavior on firm profits and consumer surplus. There are three main results. First, if every firm's manipulation strategy is a monotonically increasing (decreasing) function of that firm's true quality, strategic manipulation of online forums increases (decreases) the information value of a forum to consumers. This result implies the existence of settings where online forum manipulation benefits consumers. Second, equilibria where strategies are monotonically increasing (decreasing) functions of a firm's true quality exist in settings where the firm's net payoff function, inclusive of the cost of manipulation, is supermodular (submodular) in the firm's quality and manipulation action. Third, in a broad class of settings, if the precision of honest consumer opinions that firms manipulate is sufficiently high, firms of all types, as well as society, would be strictly better off if manipulation of online forums was not possible. Nonetheless, firms are locked into a "rat race" and forced to spend resources on such profit-reducing activities; if they don't, consumer perceptions will be biased against them. The social cost of online manipulation can be reduced by developing "filtering" technologies that make it costlier for firms to manipulate. Interestingly, as the amount of user-contributed online content increases, it is firms, and not consumers, that have most to gain from the development of such technologies. {\textcopyright} 2006 INFORMS.},

Various issues that arise in application migration such as profile matching, application context, data synchronisation and consistency are discussed. The efficiency and scalability of the WebRTC framework and mobile devices (peers) under Android in a real computing infrastructure are studied.

abstract = {In this paper, we extensively tune and then compare the performance of web servers based on three different server architectures. The $\mu$server utilizes an event-driven architecture, Knot uses the highly-efficient Capriccio thread library to implement a thread-per-connection model, and WatPipe uses a hybrid of events and threads to implement a pipeline-based server that is similar in spirit to a staged event-driven architecture (SEDA) server like Haboob. We describe modifications made to the Capriccio thread library to use Linux's zero-copy sendfile interface. We then introduce the SY mmetric Multi-Processor Event Driven (SYMPED) architecture in which relatively minor modifications are made to a single process event-driven (SPED) server (the $\mu$server) to allow it to continue processing requests in the presence of blocking due to disk accesses. Finally, we describe our C++ implementation of WatPipe, which although utilizing a pipeline-based architecture, excludes the dynamic controls over event queues and thread pools used in SEDA. When comparing the performance of these three server architectures on the workload used in our study, we arrive at different conclusions than previous studies. In spite of recent improvements to threading libraries and our further improvements to Capriccio and Knot, both the event-based $\mu$server and pipeline-based Wat-Pipe server provide better throughput (by about 18%). We also observe that when using blocking sockets to send data to clients, the performance obtained with some architectures is quite good and in one case is noticeably better than when using non-blocking sockets.

However, by centralizing data storage on servers, cloud apps also take away ownership and agency from users. If a service shuts down, the software stops functioning, and data created with that software is lost. In this article we propose local-first software, a set of principles for software that enables both collaboration and ownership for users. Local-first ideals include the ability to work offline and collaborate across multiple devices, while also improving the security, privacy, long-term preservation, and user control of data. We survey existing approaches to data storage and sharing, ranging from email attachments to web apps to Firebase-backed mobile apps, and we examine the trade-offs of each. We look at Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs): data structures that are multi-user from the ground up while also being fundamentally local and private. CRDTs have the potential to be a foundational technology for realizing local-first software. We share some of our findings from developing local-first software prototypes at the Ink & Switch research lab over the course of several years. These experiments test the viability of CRDTs in practice, and explore the user interface challenges for this new data model. Lastly, we suggest some next steps for moving towards local-first software: for researchers, for app developers, and a startup opportunity for entrepreneurs.},

These applications require reliable algorithms to ensure consistency among the participating Web clients. Operational Transformation (OT) and more recently Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDT) have become widely adopted solutions for this kind of problem. However, most existing approaches are non-trivial and require trade-offs between expressiveness, suitable infrastructure, performance and simplicity. The ever growing number of potential use cases, the new possibilities of cutting-edge messaging protocols that shaped the near real-time Web, and the use of N-way communication between clients (e.g. WebRTC), create a need for peer-topeer algorithms that perform well and are not restricted to only a few supported data types. In this paper, we present YATA, an approach for peer-to-peer shared editing applications that ensures convergence, preserves user intentions, allows offline editing and can be utilized for arbitrary data types in the Web browser.

abstract = {The use of mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, smart watches and notebooks in the agriculture sector is gaining significant popularity. Through mobile technologies, farmers are aided to quickly and easily communicate, advertise goods and services, as well as accessing agronomic data in soft-real time. Though mobile devices are a good source of agronomic information access and dissemination, the over-dependence on wireless communication protocols for communication is a bit of a challenge. Due to the mobility of farmers, the wireless networks can experience bandwidth fluctuations and that can hamper data transfer and management in mobile-server (cloud) ecosystems. To address this issue, previous works propose mobile data storage to support information access in an offline mode. However, the question of how to efficiently management the data state on the mobile is under-studied. In this work, we proposed a mobile-cloud architecture that enables farmers to manage data transfer and storage of agronomic data on their mobile devices in the face of the network challenges. Three different P2P Key-Value Storage methodologies are presented which are: 1) Bloom Filters algorithm, 2) whole state data transfer, and 3) exchange of delta (updates) only. The whole state data transfer is only recommended when there is stable wireless connection.},

The algorithm is used for real-time online text chatting, as well as offline SMS in mobile phones. Text is handled transparently without any modification in the core network. The proposed algorithm is an application of 'A-M' compression framework. Applying such algorithm will save at least 25% and up to 90% of the bandwidth depending on the context of the transferred data. Other applications such as email, web browsing, etc... will also gain from applying such algorithm. This paper demonstrated two types of applications; the real-time text chatting, and the mobile SMS application.

While traditionally collaborative editing systems would either target synchronous or asynchronous collaboration settings, some recent systems support both types of collaboration, even supporting disconnected work. In this paper we analyze the limitations of existing systems and propose a data management solution that overcomes such limitations. The proposed concurrency control algorithm, based on conflict-free data types, builds on the ideas previously developed for synchronous collaboration, extending them to support asynchronous collaboration. Our solution also includes the necessary information for providing comprehensive awareness information to users. The evaluation of our algorithm shows that comparing our solution with traditional solutions in collaborative editing, the conflict resolution strategy proposed in this paper leads to results closer to the ones expected by users. {\textcopyright} 2013 ICST.},

In order to evaluate the model, we use data from StackOverflow which also has its own reputation model. We estimate similarity of ratings between DIB-RM and the StackOverflow reputation model to test our hypothesis. We use two values to calculate our metrics: DIB-RM reputation and historical reputation. We found out that historical reputation gives better metric values. Our preliminary results are presented for different sets of values of the aforementioned factors in order to analyze how effectively the model can be used for modeling reputation systems.},

We propose a Bayesian network-based trust model and a method for building reputation based on recommendations in peer-to-peer networks. Since trust is multifaceted, peers need to develop differentiated trust in different aspects of other peers' capability. The peer's needs are different in different situations. Depending on the situation, a peer may need to consider its trust in a specific aspect of another peer's capability or in multiple aspects. Bayesian networks provide a flexible method to present differentiated trust and combine different aspects of trust. The evaluation of the model using a simulation shows that the system where peers communicate their experiences (recommendations) outperforms the system where peers do not share recommendations with each other and that a differentiated trust adds to the performance in terms of percentage of successful interactions.},

So far, this technology is well known for building trust and harnessing cooperation in on-line marketplaces, such as Amazon (www.amazon.com) and eBay (www.ebay.es). However, these mechanisms are poised to have a broader impact on a wide range of scenarios, from large scale decision making procedures, such as the ones implied in e-democracy, to trust based recommendations on e-health context or influence and performance assessment in e-marketing and e-learning systems. This contribution surveys the progress in understanding the new possibilities and challenges that trust and reputation systems pose. To do so, it discusses trust, reputation and influence which are important measures in networked based communication mechanisms to support the worthiness of information, products, services opinions and recommendations. The existent mechanisms to estimate and propagate trust and reputation, in distributed networked scenarios, and how these measures can be integrated in decision making to reach consensus among the agents are analysed. Furthermore, it also provides an overview of the relevant work in opinion dynamics and influence assessment, as part of social networks. Finally, it identifies challenges and research opportunities on how the so called trust based network can be leveraged as an influence measure to foster decision making processes and recommendation mechanisms in complex social networks scenarios with uncertain knowledge, like the mentioned in e-health and e-marketing frameworks.},

abstract = {Peer-to-Peer (P2P) reputation systems are essential to evaluate the trustworthiness of participating peers and to combat the selfish, dishonest, and malicious peer behaviors. The system collects locally-generated peer feedbacks and aggregates them to yield the global reputation scores. Surprisingly, most previous work ignored the distribution of peer feedbacks. We use a trust overlay network (TON) to model the trust relationships among peers. After examining the eBay transaction trace of over 10,000 users, we discover a power-law distribution in user feedbacks. Our mathematical analysis justifies that power-law distribution is applicable to any dynamically growing P2P systems, either structured or unstructured. We develop a robust and scalable P2P reputation system, PowerTrust, to leverage the power-law feedback characteristics. The PowerTrust system dynamically selects small number of power nodes that are most reputable using a distributed ranking mechanism. By using a look-ahead random walk strategy and leveraging the power nodes, PowerTrust significantly improves in global reputation accuracy and aggregation speed. PowerTrust is adaptable to dynamics in peer joining and leaving and robust to disturbance by malicious peers. Through P2P network simulation experiments, we find significant performance gains in using PowerTrust. This power-law guided reputation system design proves to achieve high query success rate in P2P file-sharing applications. The system also reduces the total job makespan and failure rate in large-scale, parameter-sweeping P2P Grid applications. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

In addition to maintaining consistency, the CCR approach is able to create new results from conflicts, generate alternative solutions based on collective effects of conflict operations, and support users to choose suitable conflict solutions and conflict resolution policies according to their needs.

The volume of traffic over the web has become large due to the amount of people who use it. Recently, a paradigm for web applications called Single Page Application, has become more popular. With the use of Javascript based technologies, we can run practically any type of application on the client side, and leave the server with the sole duty of serving pages and a manual of the available content and how to use it, allowing the server to handle larger amount of volume. Unfortunately, SPA are also vulnerable to malicious users as most of its functionality is located at the client side. This paper proposed a framework to enhance the existent OAuth support to create a trust and anonymous service, which can help ensure the integrity of the application and the legitimacy of the user. Results show that SPA can not just be secure, but also help with server performance, by decreasing its load at higher traffic.},

abstract = {Reputation systems concern soft security dynamics in diverse areas. Trust dynamics in a reputation system should be stable and adaptable at the same time to serve the purpose. Many reputation mechanisms have been proposed and tested over time. However, the main drawback of reputation management is that users need to share private information to gain trust in a system such as phone numbers, reviews, and ratings. Recently, a novel model that tries to overcome this issue was presented: the Dynamic Interaction-based Reputation Model (DIBRM). This approach to trust considers only implicit information automatically deduced from the interactions of users within an online community. In this primary research study, the Reddit and MathOverflow online social communities have been selected for testing DIBRM. Results show how this novel approach to trust can mimic behaviors of the selected reputation systems, namely Reddit and MathOverflow, only with temporal information.},
