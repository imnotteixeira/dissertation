\chapter{Problem Statement}\label{chap:problem}

\section*{}

This chapter describes the problem tackled in this dissertation, including the planned features and the expected result. First, it presents the features to be developed in User Story format. Then, it explains some additional technical requirements.

The implemented solution for this problem is presented in the next chapter.  

\section{Problem Definition}\label{sec:prob-def}

As mentioned in the Introduction (Chapter~\ref{chap:intro}), the project's goal is to develop a web application that allows users to follow a sporting event in a real-time chat-like environment where everyone can input game events. For users that are just following, it would work as live coverage of the event; for contributors, it should be resilient to network failures due to stadiums' Wi-Fi limitations.
Due to the above goal, some necessary features start to surface, such as real-time conflict resolution and the inherent reputation system for tie-breaking when necessary. 

A prototype that allows event submission is already available, and since it is using React, which is an appropriate technology for this task, it will be kept. Some features still need to be polished, but most of the UI is already done, which will allow a bigger focus on the actual real-time conflict resolution problem.

The features of the prototype are described as follows, in User Story format\footnote{In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. User stories are often written from the perspective of an end-user or user of a system.}:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin  = 3.25\parindent, align=left, label=US\arabic*, start=1]
    \item As a user, I want to be able to join a sport event channel, where I can see details about the event in real-time (either pre-filled or contributed by other users), so that I have information about what is happening in the event.
    \item As a user, I want to be able to be able to post event updates while on an event channel, in a chat-like interaction, so that I can easily contribute in an input experience I recognize.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Event updates include: Starting players, Goals, Fouls, Set-Pieces, Cards, Substitutions, Game-Time information, and generic match information
    \end{itemize} 
    \item As a user, I want to be able to use the application while in offline mode, and have it synchronize once the connection is resumed, so that I don't lose information nor focus when my connection drops.
    \item As a user, I want to see a value representing the reputation of other users in a given event channel, so that I have a basis on which to decide if I trust them. 
    \item As a user, I want to be able to delete inputted events, so that I can let others know that they might not be true and manifest my intention to change it.
    \item As a user, I want to be able to see if there are any pending conflicts to be resolved, so that I can clearly see if I need to solve any conflicting information.
    \item As a user, I want to be able to resolve any pending conflicts, so that I can keep the event's history clean and understandable.
    \item As a user, I want to be able to join an event channel mid-session, being able to see the previous information, so that I have more flexibility, not losing context if I arrive some time late.
    \item\label{user-story:sync-to-api} As a user, I want to be able to see the events generated on the ZeroZero platform (not ZeroZero Live), so that I can follow the game even if don't want to comment about it.
    \item\label{user-story:sync-from-api} As an official ZeroZero reporter, I want to be able to input events on the old platform, and have them synced to ZeroZero Live, so that I can use other tooling that depends on it to provide statistics, and still be able to comment manually on ZeroZero Live.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Technical Requirements}

Apart from the functional requirements above, the tool should adhere to the following technical requirements:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin  = 3.25\parindent, align=left, label=TR\arabic*, start=1]
    \item The system should use the authentication API from ZeroZero in order to authenticate users and provide session functionality;
    \item Changes and updates to the application should not require total outages of service;
    \item There will be sufficient logging to quicly identify system problems;
    \item The tool should be available as a web application, able to work on any browser (desktop, tablet or mobile);
    \item The application may require an internet connection on setup, but should be resilient to network failures mid-session;
    \item The system should be horizontally scalable as the number of users grows;
\end{enumerate}

\section{Summary}

In summary, the problem to be tackled is the development of a multi-user real-time application allowing the coverage of sporting events, with offline tolerance. That entails the existance of conflict resolution strategies, as well as a reputation system, which should take time into consideration, making reputation more dynamic.
