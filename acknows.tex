\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First, I would like to express my appreciation towards my supervisor Prof.\ João Correia Lopes for guiding me throughout this journey, correcting my wrongs and helping me learn throughout the writing of this document. I would also like to thank Eng.\ Marco Sousa, Eng.\ Pedro Dias and Eng.\ Vasco Ribeiro from the ZeroZero team, who allowed me to contribute to this project, learn about their challenges and contribute to them along the way. 

I would also like to thank my parents, who led me by example and shaped the basis of what I am today, and my sister, whom I am supposed to lead by example --- and hopefully in some years will be producing a document just like this of her own. I'd also like to give an \say{honorable mention} to my grandmother who naively thinks I am becoming a Doctor after completing this Masters' Thesis, which in itself gives a special kind of encouragement. Moreover, I would like to extend my gratitude towards my friends, many of which have crossed this bridge with me, providing support and many good memories. 

Finally, a message of appreciation to everyone that allowed me to extend my knowledge and shape my character to what it is today.
